The Soil Factory Community embodies generosity, solidarity, support, creativity, and justice. We come together to connect, be surprised, encounter, and expand our worlds; to build hope and soil; to work against the destruction of the world, isolation, and despair.

We want to foster a friendly environment of listening, empowerment, non-judgmental openness and joy, to collaborate in a spirit of flow and curiosity.

We are as Queer as we want to be.

We will act sustainably, kindly, in good faith, ethically, honestly, transparently, empathetically, and supportively.

We will be collaborative, welcoming, innovative, inclusive, grateful, spontaneous, eccentric, brave, resilient, respectful of our differences, and good company.

We will be experimental and respectful of nature, socially just, and intergenerational.

We collaborate in a spirit of defiant hope to build a community based on art, science, reciprocity, radical joy, and inspired futurism.

We will be goofy, chill, or whatever youâ€™ve got.

We will model aspiration, anticipation, repair, introspection, persuasion, and change.

We will do the dishes.

There will be snacks.
